I'm a CHECK Team Leader web app pentester and I largely build quick and dirty scripts to exploit web vulnerabilities. Some of my stuff is also in [/nettitude](http://github.com/nettitude). 

Highlights:

 - [pwnlyoffice](https://github.com/nettitude/pwnlyoffice) - Exploit ONLYOFFICE vulnerabilities for RCE
 - [xss_payloads](https://github.com/nettitude/xss_payloads) - Do better than `alert(1)`
 - [zeropress](https://github.com/nettitude/zeropress) - Dumb script for finding dumb PHP mistakes
 - [version-detective](https://github.com/strawp/version-detective) - Work out a target site's framework version using git
 - [Random Scripts](https://github.com/strawp/random-scripts) - A few surprisingly useful tools that get used in pentests quite a lot 
 - [swagger-hose](https://github.com/strawp/swagger-hose) - Ingest a whole bunch of swagger docs and squirt requests in to speed up pentest triage / fuzzing
